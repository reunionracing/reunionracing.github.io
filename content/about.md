R&eacute;union Racing is an amateur competitive cycling team based in Dallas, Texas. Created to fill a void in the region of a team driven, competition focused, community committed team honoring the historic culture of the sport, R&eacute;union Racing is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization registered with [USA Cycling](https://usacycling.org/). We are dedicated to championing and growing the sport of competitive cycling across all racing disciplines and helping dismantle the many perceived barriers for new competitors.

R&eacute;union Racing believes that competing provides a unique and rich sense of fulfillment and pride, regardless of outcome. Our team is governed by a code of ethics and conduct, and is overseen by our board of directors. While we stop short of strictly adhering to each of [Velominatiâ€™s Rules](https://www.velominati.com/), we respect their intent and the heritage and etiquette from which they stem. We believe in riding safe, treating others as you wish to be treated, exceptional sportsmanship and leading by example.
